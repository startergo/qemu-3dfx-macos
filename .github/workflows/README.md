# GitHub Actions Workflows for QEMU 3dfx

This directory contains comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows for building, testing, packaging, and distributing QEMU with 3dfx Glide and Mesa GL pass-through support.

## üîß Workflow Overview

### 1. **Build and Package** (`build-and-package.yml`) ‚úÖ ACTIVE
**Triggers**: Push to master/develop, tags, manual dispatch  
**Purpose**: Complete build and packaging pipeline

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ Multi-architecture builds (ARM64, x86_64)
- ‚úÖ Architecture-optimized builds (Intel builds x86 only, ARM64 builds all)
- ‚úÖ Full QEMU 9.2.2 compilation with 3dfx patches
- ‚úÖ Automatic tarball creation with zstd compression
- ‚úÖ SHA256 checksum generation
- ‚úÖ Commit-based versioning for VM addon compatibility
- ‚úÖ Artifact upload for testing and distribution

**Outputs**:
- `qemu-9.2.2-3dfx-{commit}-darwin-{arch}.tar.zst`
- `qemu-9.2.2-3dfx-{commit}-darwin-{arch}.tar.zst.sha256`
- Staging directories for testing

### 2. **Test and Validate Distribution** (`sign-and-distribute.yml`) ‚úÖ ACTIVE
**Triggers**: Completion of build workflow, manual dispatch  
**Purpose**: Distribution testing and signing preparation (NOT actual signing)

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ Distribution integrity testing (checksum, extraction)
- ‚úÖ Binary functionality validation
- ‚úÖ Signing script validation (syntax, dependencies)
- ‚úÖ Installation process simulation
- ‚úÖ Installation guide generation
- ‚úÖ Architecture-specific testing

**Outputs**:
- Distribution test reports
- Installation guides with usage examples
- Distribution summaries with file listings

**Note**: This workflow does NOT sign binaries. Actual signing is done by end users after installation using the included signing script.

### 3. **Test Binary Distribution** (`test-binary-distribution.yml`) ‚úÖ ACTIVE
**Triggers**: Manual dispatch with tarball URL  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive testing of binary distributions

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ Download and verify external tarballs
- ‚úÖ Checksum verification
- ‚úÖ 3dfx device functionality testing
- ‚úÖ Commit ID compatibility verification
- ‚úÖ Signing process simulation
- ‚úÖ Detailed test reporting

### 4. **Legacy Workflows** üö´ DISABLED
The following workflows have been disabled as their functionality is now provided by the active workflows above:

- **`ci.yml`** - Replaced by `build-and-package.yml`
- **`release.yml`** - Replaced by `build-and-package.yml` + `sign-and-distribute.yml`  
- **`release-test.yml`** - Replaced by `build-and-package.yml`
- **`test-build.yml`** - Replaced by `build-and-package.yml`
- **`pr-test.yml`** - PR testing now handled by `build-and-package.yml`

These can be manually enabled via workflow dispatch if needed for debugging.

## üöÄ Usage Guide

### For Developers

#### Running a Complete Build
```bash
# Trigger via GitHub UI or API
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/startergo/qemu-3dfx-macos/actions/workflows/build-and-package.yml/dispatches \
  -d '{"ref":"master","inputs":{"create_release":"false","target_arch":"arm64"}}'
```

#### Testing Distribution Workflow
1. Go to Actions ‚Üí "Test and Validate Distribution"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select architecture: `arm64`, `x86_64`, or `all`
4. The workflow will test the latest successful build artifacts

#### Testing a Binary Distribution
1. Go to Actions ‚Üí "Test Binary Distribution"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Enter the tarball URL (e.g., from a release)
4. Configure test options:
   - `test_installation`: Full installation simulation
   - `test_commit_match`: Verify VM addon compatibility

#### Creating a Release
1. Tag your commit: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0`
2. The build workflow will automatically create a GitHub release
3. Or manually trigger with `create_release: true`

### For Users

#### Download and Install
1. Go to the [Releases page](../../releases)
2. Download the appropriate tarball for your architecture:
   - Apple Silicon: `*-darwin-arm64.tar.zst`
   - Intel: `*-darwin-x86_64.tar.zst`
3. Verify checksum: `shasum -a 256 -c *.sha256`
4. Install: `sudo tar --zstd -xf *.tar.zst -C /`
5. **Sign binaries** (REQUIRED): `cd $(brew --prefix)/sign && bash ./qemu.sign`

**Important**: Step 5 is where the actual code signing happens. The binaries are unsigned in the distribution and must be signed by each user in their own environment.

## üîç Workflow Details

### Environment Variables
- `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE`: Prevents Homebrew updates during builds
- `HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP`: Speeds up dependency installation
- `COMMIT_SHORT`: 7-character commit hash for versioning
- `BUILD_IDENTIFIER`: Used for code signing (e.g., `qemu-3dfx-macos@abc1234`)

### Architecture Support
- **ARM64**: Apple Silicon Macs (M1, M2, M3) - Builds all targets (i386, x86_64, aarch64)
- **x86_64**: Intel Macs - Builds x86 targets only (i386, x86_64) for efficiency
- **Cross-compilation**: ARM64 runners can build for all architectures

### Build Process
1. **Checkout**: Full git history for commit tracking
2. **Dependencies**: Install Homebrew packages and build tools
3. **Source**: Download QEMU 9.2.2 source
4. **Patch**: Apply 3dfx/mesa overlays and patches
5. **Build**: Compile with architecture-optimized target lists
6. **Package**: Create directory structure and tarball with unsigned binaries
7. **Prepare Signing**: Include signing script with current commit ID
8. **Upload**: Store artifacts for testing and distribution

**Note**: Binaries are distributed unsigned and must be signed by end users.

### Testing Strategy
- **Build Tests**: Architecture-optimized compilation validation
- **Distribution Tests**: Binary package validation and functionality
- **Installation Tests**: End-to-end user experience simulation
- **Signing Tests**: Signing script validation (syntax, dependencies)
- **Compatibility Tests**: VM addon version matching

**Note**: Testing validates the signing process but does not perform actual signing.

## üîß Configuration

### Workflow Inputs

#### Build and Package
- `create_release`: Create GitHub release (boolean)
- `target_arch`: Architecture to build (arm64/x86_64/universal)

#### Test and Validate Distribution
- `artifact_name`: Specific artifact to process (string)
- `architecture`: Target architecture (arm64/x86_64/all)

#### Test Binary Distribution
- `tarball_url`: URL to test tarball (string)
- `test_installation`: Full installation test (boolean)
- `test_commit_match`: VM addon compatibility test (boolean)

### Secrets Required
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub
- No additional secrets needed for basic functionality

### Dependencies
- **macOS runners**: Required for native builds and signing
- **Homebrew**: Package management and dependency installation
- **Xcode tools**: Code signing and development tools
- **XQuartz**: X11 support for graphics acceleration

## üìä Monitoring and Debugging

### Artifact Retention
- **Build artifacts**: 30 days
- **Test artifacts**: 7 days
- **Installation guides**: 90 days

### Log Analysis
Each workflow step includes detailed logging:
- ‚úÖ Success indicators
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning messages
- ‚ùå Error conditions
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Informational status

### Common Issues
1. **Missing test-ci.sh**: Legacy workflows disabled - use build-and-package.yml instead
2. **Binary naming (-unsigned suffix)**: Modern QEMU creates unsigned binaries, workflows handle this automatically  
3. **Architecture mismatches**: Verify runner compatibility and target architecture
4. **Dependency errors**: Review Homebrew package availability
5. **Build timeouts**: Optimized builds should complete within 2 hours
6. **Signing failures**: Users must sign binaries after installation in their own environment

## üõ† Maintenance

### Updating QEMU Version
1. Update patch file references in workflows
2. Modify download URLs in build scripts
3. Test compatibility with new QEMU features
4. Update version strings in documentation

### Adding New Architectures
1. Update build matrix in `build-and-package.yml`
2. Add architecture-specific configurations
3. Update artifact naming conventions
4. Test cross-compilation scenarios

### Security Updates
1. Regularly update action versions (`@v4`, etc.)
2. Monitor for security advisories
3. Update dependency versions in brew installs
4. Review code signing certificate requirements
